A Google home page clone as part of The Odin Project web dev course.

The google was to replicate the Google home page only using HTML and CSS.

What I learned:
- learned how to use the browser(FireFox) dev tools to view page layout and CSS styling for the page elements.

The biggest problem I faced was determining how the styling for different elements worked together. In some situations, padding or margin of one element would in turn change the sizing or text size of another.

I was able to over come this issue by studying the individual CSS properties that were giving me issues.
